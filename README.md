# spotify-history-analytics

This project analyzes Spotify streaming history data to uncover key insights about user behavior and music trends. It explores various metrics such as song play counts, skip rates, playtime by tracks, albums, and artists, as well as platform usage and listening habits across different times (hours, days, months, and years). The analysis is designed to identify patterns and trends, helping to better understand user preferences and engagement on the platform. The project also includes performance indicators (KPIs) like the most played tracks, skipped songs, and platforms, as well as a breakdown of playtime based on different reasons and platforms.

## Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into user behavior and music trends within Spotify streaming history. By analyzing key metrics such as the number of songs played, skipping rates, total playtime, and user preferences across different artists, albums, and platforms, we were able to uncover patterns that offer a deeper understanding of how users interact with the platform. The analysis also highlighted the importance of various time-related factors, such as peak listening hours and days, which can help inform better user experience strategies.

Furthermore, this project demonstrated the power of SQL in processing large datasets and extracting meaningful insights that could be used for decision-making and further research in music streaming behavior. It has been an enriching experience that allowed me to apply data analysis skills to real-world data and draw conclusions that can influence future music consumption trends and marketing strategies.

Moving forward, this analysis could be expanded by incorporating additional data sources, exploring more granular details of user interactions, and applying machine learning techniques to predict future listening habits.
